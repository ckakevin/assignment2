  <h1>Paperbag by Fiona Apple</h1>
  </p>

  <p>
  <div class="change">
    <br>
  I was staring at the sky
  just looking for a star
    </br>
  </div>

  <div id="shift">
    <br>
  to pray on or wish on
  or something like that
    </br>
  </div>

  <div class="change">
    <br>
  I was having a sweet fix
  of a daydream of a boy
  whose reality, I knew,
  was a hopeless to be had
    </br>
  </div>

  <div id="secondshift">
    <br>
  but then the dove of hope
  began its downward slope
  and I believed for a moment that
  my chances were
  Approaching to be grabbed
    </br>
  </div>

  <div class="change">
    <br>
  but as it came down near,
  so did a weary tear
  I thought it was a bird,
  but it was just a paper bag
    </br>
  </div>

  <div id="thirdshift">
    <br>
  hunger hurts,
  and I want him so bad, oh it kills
  'cause I know I'm a mess he don't wanna clean up
  I got to fold 'cause these hands are too shaky to hold
    </br>
  </div>

  <div class="change">
    <br>
  hunger hurts but starvin' works
  when it costs too much to love
  and I went crazy again today
  looking for a strand to climb
  looking for a little hope
  baby said he couldn't stay
  wouldn't put his lips to mine
    </br>
  </div>

  <div id="fourthshift">
    <br>
  a fail to kiss is a fail to cope
  I said, "Honey, I don't feel so good,
  don't feel justified.
  come on put a little love here in my void"
  he said "It's all in your head"
  And I said "So's everything"
  but he didn't get it
  I thought he was a man
  but he was just a little boy
    </br>
  </div>
