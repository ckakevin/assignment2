    I was staring at the sky
    just looking for a star

    to pray on or wish on
    or something like that
    </br>

    <br>
    I was having a sweet fix
    of a daydream of a boy
    whose reality, I knew,
    was a hopeless to be had
    </br>

    <br>
    but then the dove of hope
    began its downward slope
    and I believed for a moment that
    my chances were
    Approaching to be grabbed
    </br>

    <br>
    but as it came down near,
    so did a weary tear
    I thought it was a bird,
    but it was just a paper bag
    </br>

    <br>
    hunger hurts,
    and I want him so bad, oh it kills
    'cause I know I'm a mess he don't wanna clean up
    I got to fold 'cause these hands are too shaky to hold
    </br>

    <br>
    hunger hurts but starvin' works
    when it costs too much to love
    and I went crazy again today
    looking for a strand to climb
    looking for a little hope
    baby said he couldn't stay
    wouldn't put his lips to mine
    </br>

    <br>
    a fail to kiss is a fail to cope
    I said, "Honey, I don't feel so good,
    don't feel justified.
    come on put a little love here in my void"
    he said "It's all in your head"
    And I said "So's everything"
    but he didn't get it
    I thought he was a man
    but he was just a little boy
    </br>
