<br>I was staring at the sky
Just looking for a star
To pray on or wish on
Or something like that
I was having a sweet fix
Of a daydream of a boy
Whose reality I knew,
</br>
<br>
Was a hopeless to be had
But then the dove of hope
Began its downward slope
And I believed for a moment that
My chances were
</br>
<br>
Approaching to be grabbed
But as it came down near,
So did a weary tear
I thought it was a bird,
But it was just a paper bag
</br>
<br>
Hunger hurts, And I want him so bad, oh it kills
'Cause I know I'm a mess he don't wanna clean up
I got to fold 'cause these hands are too shaky to hold
Hunger hurts but starvin' works
When it costs too much to love
</br>
<br>
And I went crazy again today
Looking for a strand to climb
Looking for a little hope
</br>
<br>
Baby said he couldn't stay
Wouldn't put his lips to mine
A fail to kiss is a fail to cope
I said, "Honey, I don't feel so good,
Don't feel justified.
</br>
<br>
Come on put a little love here in my void"
He said "It's all in your head"
And I said "So's everything"
But he didn't get it
I thought he was a man
But he was just a little boy
